# Wmarks
I created this Windows batch based filemarking program to help me find files on large company servers.

I find it is much easier to remember short bookmark tags than long file names, particularly when you have no personal control over the file structure or file naming conventions.

Right click a file location in Windows explorer, add a short text tag, then you can open that location by typing in that tag. 
If multiple files have the same tag you can narrow it down by entering additional tags.
Using Wmarks, groups of users on a common server can share file tags.

I initially created the marks program using only batch scripts and csv files for the databases. There is no SQL involved- I coded the CRUD functions with no prior knowledge of SQL.
