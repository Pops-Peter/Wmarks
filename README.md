# Wmarks
Windows batch based filemarking program

I find it is much easier to remember short bookmark tags in a database than long file names.

Right click a file location in Windows explorer, add a short text tag, then open that location by typing in the tag. 
If multiple files have the same tag you can narrow it down by entering additional tags.
Using Wmarks, groups of users on a common server can share file tags.

I initially created the marks program using only batch scripts and csv files for the databases. There is no SQL involved- I coded the CRUD functions with no prior knowledge of SQL.
